                In Belgium, pop art was represented by Paul Van Hoeydonck, whose sculpture <em> Fallen Astronaut </em> was left on the moon during one of the moon missions. Internationally recognized artists such as Marcel Broodthaers and Panamarenko are indebted to the pop art movement; Broodthaers's great influence was George Segal. Another well-known artist, Roger Raveel, mounted a birdcage with a real live pigeon in one of his paintings. By the end of the 1960s and early 1970s, pop art references disappeared from the work of these artists when they started to adopt a more critical attitude towards America because of the Vietnam War's increasingly gruesome character. Panamarenko, however, has retained the irony inherent in the pop art movement up to the present day.
